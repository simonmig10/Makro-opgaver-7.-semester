# Endogenous growth theory

Assume production functionof final goods sector is given by: $$Y(t)=[(1+\alpha_K)K(t)^\alpha][A(t)(1-\alpha_L)L(t)]^{1-\alpha}$$

where $1-\alpha_L$ and $1-\alpha_K$ is proportion of labour and capital allocated for final production

Capital stock is given by: $$\dot K(t) = sY(t)$$

Production functions of R&D sector is given by: $$\dot A(t)=B[\alpha_K K(t)]^\beta[\alpha_L L(t)]^\gamma A(t)^\theta$$

where $B>0$ showa efficiency of research, $\gamma \in(0,1)$ is the output elasticity of labour allocated in R&D, and $\theta \leq 1$ is a parameter describing the elasticity of existing knowledge $(A)$ for the prodcution of increases in the stock of knownledge.

Population growth is exogenous $$\frac{\dot L(t)}{L(t)} = n \quad or \quad \dot L(t)=nL(t)$$

## Derive an expression for the growth rate of capital $g_K(t)$ and growth rate of technology gA(t)
