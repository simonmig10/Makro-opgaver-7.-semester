**Assume production function of final goods sector is given by:**
$$Y(t)=[(1-a_K)K(t)^\alpha][A(t)(1-a_L)L(t)]^{1-\alpha}$$
Where $1-a_L$ and $1-a_K$ is the proportion of labour and capital allocated for final production

Capital stock is given by:
$$\dot{K}(t)=sY(t)$$

Production function of R&D sector is given by

*Derive an expression for the growth rate of capital* $gK(t)$ *and growth rate of technology* $gA(t)$
